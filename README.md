# Hello my name is Kevin Jeffrey House Jr!

I am a third-year student at Iowa State University and am pursuing an Aerospace Engineering Degree with a Nondestructive Evaluation Minor. I am a military kid, so I have traveled around Europe a lot and hope to travel around the States as well. I am currently working for the FAA as a Student Trainee. Finally, Christianity and my relaationhip with Jesus is something I love to share. Below is a table to get to know me more.
